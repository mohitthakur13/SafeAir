 ## Description
 Data Analytics platform is a processing pipeline that works in the following way: 
 <ol>
 <li> Data is inputted to the processing stack (data_stack.py) - At this time of submission, as the API was not active, the data is being read from the file device_data. </li>
 <li>The stack is LIFO, implying that the latest data is processed first. It assumes that the data is being fed to it in a time chronological manner. </li>
 <li> The stack then sends the reading (one by one) to the pollutant analytics engine (pollutanta_data/analytics.py) and the index engines (index_analytics/[ENGINE_NAME].py).
<ol>
<li>The pollutant analytics engine computes the pollutant analytics and sends it to the consolidator (analytics_consolidator.py). </li>
<li> Index engines compute the value of the indices and sends it to the alert engine (index_analytics/analytics.py - which is a classifier of the index values). </li> 
 <li> The alert engine uses user_settings.py to read the index operational ranges set by the user. </li>
</li>
<li> The alert engine appends the index value and the alert analytics for the index and sends it to the consolidator. </li>
<li> The consolidator then collects the pollutant analytics and the index analytics and appends to the reading and sends it to the output writer. </li>
<li> The output writer outputs the analytics into the JSON format in the file output/output.data </li>
 </ol>
